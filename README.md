The final project of "Introduction To Databases", where we created a website for movie crew hiring, and the DB linked to it.
Our platforms included: MySQL, Rapid API and our university web host. We designed the DB from scrach, to optimize the SQL quries we wrote. Then, we filled it from data
we fetched from TMDB, useing python and a designated API. We later designed a website, using HTML and JavaScript, to execute the queries according to user input. 
Screenshots can be found in the SRC/APPLICATION-SOURCE-CODE/templates/ folder of this repository.
